    <p> Boeing was thrown into crisis after a panel known as a door plug became detached from Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario International Airport in southern California on Friday, six minutes after takeoff when it was already 14,800 feet in the air.The FAA ordered the grounding of the country's entire fleet of 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes Saturday; the following day, a high school teacher, Bob Sauer, found the missing door panel in the backyard of his Portland home.</p>
